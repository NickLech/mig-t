-   [x] Add the decode of a parameter in passives
-   [x] Add columns to test results (Test Name | Test Description | References | Violated Properties | Mitigation |)
-   [ ] Add oracle description on the test suite
-   [ ] Add check's from option, from decoded param, in a way that checks could be executed on a decoded param
-   [ ] Improve the error feedback on the plugin, for example by highlighting the part of the plugin that failed or by writing a string
    -   [x] JSON Test track
    -   [x] Tabs of JSON and sessions configs to higlhight red in case of errors
    -   [ ] Browser track
-   [ ] Check the add action in message operations
-   [ ] sessions list in test are updated incorrectly
-   [ ] Add the anti-proxybypass localhost rule to firefox
-   [ ] JWT edit and add is applicable only to root keys in the jwt JSON, it is not possible to edit the child elements with these commands.
-   [ ] JWT raw string methods are not jet implemented
-   [ ] Implement new session objects in the test
-   [ ] If session is stopped before the update of the track, the session operations does not have any effect
-   [ ] sessions list in test are updated incorrectly
-   [ ] Improve error feedbacks with detailed informations
-   [ ] Intermittent problem: burp.ParsingException: variable "var_host" not defined. It could be caused by a race condition between threads, has to be checked
-   [ ] Add an assert on the session to check the text content of an element in the page
-   [ ] Parse the jwt sections as JSON to avoid inaccessibility of child elements (?)
-   [ ] Add an optional session action (if the element is not found skip the action without counting as an error)
-   [ ] Add assert text inside element
-   [ ] Add assert color
-   [ ] Think of a way to inject cookies in sessions
-   [ ] Add a button in the tool to resume the execution after a certain pause action, for example to solve captcha
-   [ ] Allow passives tests to be executed on a session different from mainSession 

## Discarded

-   [ ] Implement the delay test for token expiration
-   [ ] Add server's metadata specific passive checks
-   [ ] divide the self self-sign Assertion or Message command in language
-   [ ] ??? Fix operation.applicable on all message operations (now is just at the first)
-   [ ] Save last JSON test in config.json and reload it at the next startup
-   [ ] Add to the documentation how to disable chrome's warnings over non secure connections (chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost) enable

## IDEAS

-   Think about a way to specify the OR in the check
-   Define the replay tag as a macro of elementar operations
-   Define some type of test where given a timeout, a token (or other?) is tested to see if is still valid waiting for the timeout.
-   make json to specify the checks to be done associated with a message type, i.e. Authentication Request
-   A JSON config file, like for the filterings
-   Should remove parameter be available to the body section??
-   In message section "all" when deleting a param, if the name of a parameter is present more of one time, what should i do? delete them all?
-   New Actives oracle make sense?
-   In actives, in message operations, is it really useful to apply an action to the entire message?
-   in actives, in message operations, what are the possible params? url parameters and HTTP parameters? or url parameters inside the value of an HTTP parameter too?
-   In actives, in message operations, in ADD, what should i add to BODY?
